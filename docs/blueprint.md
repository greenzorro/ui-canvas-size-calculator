## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light beige (#F2F4F3) for a clean, uncluttered backdrop that reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: Yellow-Green (#B3D68C) as a subtle but contrasting accent color for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif; clear, modern appearance.
- Use minimalist icons to represent screen properties.
- Use a responsive, single-column layout for ease of use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Implement subtle animations when the user adjusts an input value to show updates in real-time.
